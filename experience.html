					<h1>Experience</h1>
					<p>
						Since early 2022 I've been the Creative Content Engineer at
						<a
							href="https://www.knowbe4.com/"
							target="_blank"
							>KnowBe4</a
						>, a security awareness training platform that helps organizations
						train their employees to recognize and avoid cybersecurity threats.
						My role is to create fake phishing emails based on real-world
						attacks that are sent to employees to test if they will fall for
						these simulated attacks. I am also the developer and administrator
						for KnowBe4's
						<a
							href="https://support.knowbe4.com"
							target="_blank"
							>Knowledge Base</a
						>.
					</p>

					<p>
						Prior to that I served as the executive director of the non-profit
						<a
							href="https://www.bikeflorida.org"
							target="_blank"
							>Bike Florida</a
						>, where I worked with state and local governmental agencies to
						promote bicycle safety awareness through tourism.
					</p>
					<p>
						In my free time you'll find me either reading, playing
						<a

							>my all-time favorite video game</a
						>, dabbling in photography, or traveling the world.
